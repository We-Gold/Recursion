# Recursion

Fun Fractals Trees And More! Made in Processing

## Fractal Trees

This is a simple demo of recursive fractal trees in processing!

(This demo looks significantly better if you run the program in processing, due to the low quality of the gif)

### Abnormal Fractal Trees

This is a demo of two types of more complex fractal trees. 
One tree can split into many branches, not just two. 
The other can have each branch split at a different angle.

## Sierpinski Carpet

This is a demo of a recursively generated sierpinski carpet!

(The larger the size of the window, the more detailed the image!)
